* Forked from TabCoin/TAB
* As original dev went quiet

NOTES:
The default P2P port in this coin is the same as several others, 
and the pchmesagestart is the same as BitcoinFast. As a result,
be careful running this alongside other wallets.  You can override
the ports in the .conf file or on command line with -port=12345 and 
-rpcport=23456 just put whatever unique numbers in.

- Fixed the commented out check for POW_CUTOFF_BLOCK on line 2113 of main.cpp.
